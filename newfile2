If a fully automatic solution has been deemed to be acceptable, then there is no need for human judgement, and thus no need for you to design a vis tool. For example, consider the domain of stock market trading. Currently, there are many deployed systems for high-frequency trading that make decisions about buying and selling stocks when certain market conditions hold, when a specific price is reached, for example, with no need at all for a time-consuming check from a human in the loop. You would not want to design a vis tool to help a person make that check faster, because even an augmented human will not be able to reason about millions of stocks every second.
